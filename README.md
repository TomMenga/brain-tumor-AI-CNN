<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

We will use [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) to train a convolutional Neural Network using a dataset of ~4600 labeled images of brains.  
Subsequently we will evaluate the accuracy of our model against a test dataset

This is part 1 of the final project of the executive path in "***Data Science and Business Analiytics***" held by the [POLIMI Graduate School of Management of Milan](https://www.som.polimi.it/) ( You can find part 2 [here](https://github.com/giuseppebrb/BrainTumorDetection) )



### Built With

* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
* [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
